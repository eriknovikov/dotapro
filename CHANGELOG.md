## Guidelines

1. **One entry per change set** - Group related changes into a single dated entry
2. **Use imperative mood** - "Add feature" not "Added feature"
3. **Be specific** - Include file names and line numbers when helpful
4. **Link to issues/PRs** - When applicable, include references
5. **Breaking changes** - Mark with `### Breaking` under the entry

## Backtracking

When debugging issues, search this file for:
1. The date when behavior changed
2. The specific component/file that was modified
3. Cross-reference with git blame for line-level changes
